            <div class="concept-description">
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like giving machines a brain to think and act like humans in certain ways. Just like how you learn to recognize your friend's face or understand different languages, AI helps computers learn these skills too!
            </div>
            
            <div class="real-world-example">
                <h4>🎬 Real-World Example: Netflix Recommendations</h4>
                <p>When you finish watching a movie on Netflix, have you noticed how it suggests other movies you might like? That's AI at work! The system looks at what you've watched, what you liked, and what similar people enjoyed, then makes smart guesses about what you'd want to watch next. It's like having a friend who knows your taste in movies perfectly.</p>

                <h4>🎯 Fun Fact</h4>
                <p>You probably interact with AI at least 10 times a day without realizing it! From unlocking your phone with your face, asking Siri a question, getting directions on Google Maps, to seeing targeted ads on social media - AI is everywhere!</p>

                <br><br>
                <strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</strong> Like a specialist who's really good at one job - your email spam filter, a chess-playing computer, or a voice assistant.
                <br><br>
                <strong>General AI (Strong AI):</strong> Like a super-smart person who can do any job - this doesn't exist yet, but it's what scientists are working toward.

                Machine Learning is like teaching a computer to learn patterns by showing it examples, just like how you learned to recognize different dog breeds by looking at many pictures of dogs. Instead of programming every single rule, we let the computer figure out the patterns on its own.

                <p>Your email doesn't have a list of every possible spam message. Instead, it learned by looking at millions of emails that people marked as "spam" or "not spam." It noticed patterns like certain words, sender behaviors, or suspicious links. Now when a new email arrives, it checks these patterns to decide if it's probably spam.</p>

                    <strong>Answer:</strong> LLMs generate text by predicting what's most likely to come next based on patterns in training data, not by actually "knowing" facts. When faced with topics they haven't seen much, or when making logical connections, they might generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information. This reveals that LLMs are sophisticated pattern-matching systems rather than true knowledge databases - they're great at reproducing patterns from their training but don't have real understanding or fact-checking abilities.

                Imagine you're reading a mystery novel, and you need to figure out who "he" refers to in a sentence. You don't just look at the word before it - you consider the entire chapter, remembering all the male characters mentioned. Transformers work similarly - they look at all words in a sentence at once and figure out how each word relates to every other word, making them incredibly good at understanding context.
            </div>
            
            <div class="real-world-example">
                <h4>🔍 Real-World Example: Google Search</h4>
                <p>When you search "apple stock price," Google needs to understand you mean Apple the company, not apple the fruit. Transformers help by looking at the context clue "stock price" and connecting it to financial information about Apple Inc., not grocery stores selling apples.

                The key innovation in Transformers is called "attention." It's like having a superpower where you can instantly see how every word in a sentence connects to every other word. This helps the AI understand complex relationships, pronoun references, and context much better than older methods.
            </div>

            <div class="real-world-example">
                <h4>📚 Real-World Example: Reading Comprehension</h4>
                <p>Consider: "The dog chased the cat. It was very fast." What does "it" refer to? A Transformer looks at both sentences simultaneously, sees that "chased" suggests movement and speed, and correctly determines that "it" likely refers to whichever animal was doing the chasing - the dog. This attention mechanism makes AI much better at understanding stories and conversations.</p>

                <div class="answer" id="q10">
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Transformers can look at both sentences simultaneously and use attention to connect "them" back to "keys" and understand the full context. Older models might get confused because they process words in sequence and might lose track of what "them" refers to by the time they reach the second sentence.

                <div class="answer" id="q11">
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> The attention mechanism would look at surrounding context to determine meaning. If the previous sentences mentioned someone using a telescope to observe, it would likely interpret it as "I (using a telescope) saw the man." If the context was about people carrying objects, it might interpret it as "I saw the man (who had a telescope)." The attention helps disambiguate by considering broader context.

                <div class="answer" id="q12">
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> The limitation is computational complexity - attention mechanisms require processing every word against every other word, which grows exponentially with document length. For a 1000-word document, that's 1 million connections to process! Solutions include: 1) Breaking long documents into chunks, 2) Using "sparse attention" that only focuses on nearby and important words, 3) Hierarchical processing that first summarizes sections then processes the summaries, or 4) More efficient architectures like "linear attention" that reduce computational requirements.

            <div class="concept-description">
                Generative AI is like having a creative partner who can make new things from scratch - write stories, create images, compose music, or even write computer code. It's different from other AI that just analyzes or recognizes things. Instead of just understanding what you show it, generative AI creates something completely new based on what it has learned.
            </div>
            
            <div class="real-world-example">
                <h4>🖼️ Real-World Example: DALL-E Image Creation</h4>
                <p>You can tell DALL-E: "Draw a cat wearing a space suit riding a unicorn through a rainbow." Even though this exact image has never existed, DALL-E combines its knowledge of cats, space suits, unicorns, and rainbows to create a completely original image that matches your description. It's not copying - it's genuinely creating something new.</p>

            <div class="concept-description">
                Think of generative AI like a master chef who has tasted thousands of dishes. The chef doesn't just memorize recipes - they understand flavors, techniques, and combinations so well that they can create entirely new dishes that still taste amazing. Generative AI learns patterns from millions of examples and uses that understanding to create original content.

                <p>A small business owner needs social media posts but can't afford a marketing team. They tell generative AI: "Write 5 Instagram captions for a cozy coffee shop, emphasizing warmth and community." The AI creates original, engaging captions that fit the brand voice, each with different angles - morning motivation, afternoon comfort, weekend vibes, etc. Each caption is unique but captures the desired feeling.</p>

Ethical questions include: copyright and attribution (whose work is it?), the nature of creativity and originality, fair use of training data, and potential impact on human artists. It also raises questions about how we define "original" work when humans also learn by studying existing art.

                Context is everything the AI remembers from your current conversation. It's like the AI's short-term memory - it can remember what you talked about earlier in the chat, but it has limits. The "context window" is how much it can remember at once, like having a notepad that only fits a certain number of pages.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Critical considerations include: 1) Never suggesting definitive diagnoses, only "considerations for evaluation," 2) Always emphasizing the need for professional medical judgment, 3) Including disclaimers about emergency situations, 4) Structuring prompts to request evidence-based reasoning, 5) Asking for differential diagnoses ranked by likelihood with supporting evidence, 6) Requesting red flag symptoms that require immediate attention, 7) Ensuring prompts don't lead to bias (age, gender, race), and 8) Including requirements to cite medical literature or guidelines. The prompt must make clear the AI is a research tool, not a diagnostic tool, and all outputs require physician review.
