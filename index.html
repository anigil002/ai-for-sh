                    <p>When you finish watching a movie on Netflix, have you noticed how it suggests other movies you might like? That's AI at work! The system looks at what you've watched, what you liked, and what similar people enjoyed, then makes smart guesses about what you'd want to watch next. It's like having a friend who knows your taste in movies perfectly.</p>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> They would typically need multiple specialized AI systems or one complex system with different modules. One part would use Natural Language Processing to understand the feedback sentiment, and another part would use text generation to create appropriate responses. Each task requires different AI capabilities, even though they might be integrated into one platform for the user.

                <div class="concept-description">
                    LLMs learn by playing a massive "fill-in-the-blank" game. They read millions of sentences with some words hidden, then try to guess what comes next. Over time, they get incredibly good at predicting not just the next word, but understanding context, meaning, and even emotional tone.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> LLMs generate text by predicting what's most likely to come next based on patterns in training data, not by actually "knowing" facts. When faced with topics they haven't seen much, or when making logical connections, they might generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information. This reveals that LLMs are sophisticated pattern-matching systems rather than true knowledge databases - they're great at reproducing patterns from their training but don't have real understanding or fact-checking abilities.

                <div class="concept-description">
                    The key innovation in Transformers is called "attention." It's like having a superpower where you can instantly see how every word in a sentence connects to every other word. This helps the AI understand complex relationships, pronoun references, and context much better than older methods.

                    <p>Consider: "The dog chased the cat. It was very fast." What does "it" refer to? A Transformer looks at both sentences simultaneously, sees that "chased" suggests movement and speed, and correctly determines that "it" likely refers to whichever animal was doing the chasing - the dog. This attention mechanism makes AI much better at understanding stories and conversations.</p>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Transformers can look at both sentences simultaneously and use attention to connect "them" back to "keys" and understand the full context. Older models might get confused because they process words in sequence and might lose track of what "them" refers to by the time they reach the second sentence.

                    <div class="answer" id="q11">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> The attention mechanism would look at surrounding context to determine meaning. If the previous sentences mentioned someone using a telescope to observe, it would likely interpret it as "I (using a telescope) saw the man." If the context was about people carrying objects, it might interpret it as "I saw the man (who had a telescope)." The attention helps disambiguate by considering broader context.

                    <div class="answer" id="q12">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> The limitation is computational complexity - attention mechanisms require processing every word against every other word, which grows exponentially with document length. For a 1000-word document, that's 1 million connections to process! Solutions include: 1) Breaking long documents into chunks, 2) Using "sparse attention" that only focuses on nearby and important words, 3) Hierarchical processing that first summarizes sections then processes the summaries, or 4) More efficient architectures like "linear attention" that reduce computational requirements.

This allows cross-language search where a Spanish query could find relevant English documentation. Challenges include: 1) Cultural context differences (concepts that exist in one culture but not others), 2) Idiomatic expressions that don't translate directly, 3) Technical terminology that varies between languages, 4) Ensuring balanced training data across languages to prevent bias toward dominant languages, and 5) Handling code-switching where multilingual users mix languages in their queries.

The chef doesn't just memorize recipes - they understand flavors, techniques, and combinations so well that they can create entirely new dishes that still taste amazing. Generative AI learns patterns from millions of examples and uses that understanding to create original content.

                    <div class="answer" id="q16">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> A regular AI recognizes and analyzes existing content ("This is a picture of a dog"), while generative AI creates new content from scratch ("Draw me a picture of a purple dog wearing sunglasses"). One understands what already exists, the other creates what has never existed before.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Generative AI can create unlimited unique problems tailored to each student's specific interests and skill level. Instead of filling in blanks in templates, it can generate completely original scenarios - a basketball problem for one student, a cooking problem for another, all at the appropriate difficulty level. It can also ensure variety so students don't get bored with repetitive formats.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> This reveals several key points: 1) Generative AI learns from patterns in training data and can sometimes reproduce too closely what it learned, 2) True creativity vs. sophisticated pattern matching is still debated, 3) The AI might be overfitting to prominent examples in its training. Ethical questions include: copyright and attribution (whose work is it?), the nature of creativity and originality, fair use of training data, and potential impact on human artists. It also raises questions about how we define "original" work when humans also learn by studying existing art.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> Because the AI has a limited context window (like short-term memory). When the conversation gets too long, the oldest parts fall out of its "memory" to make room for new information. It's like a notepad with limited pages - when you add new pages at the back, the old ones at the front fall off.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong> You could: 1) Break the document into smaller sections and analyze each separately, 2) Ask the AI to summarize each section first, then work with the summaries, 3) Focus on specific parts most relevant to your research question, or 4) Use the AI to extract key points from each section and then combine them.

                    <div class="answer" id="q21">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> The company might use a multi-stage approach: 1) Use a vector database to store all documentation and retrieve only relevant sections for each query, 2) Implement conversation summarization to compress long interactions, 3) Create a ticket history summary system that keeps key context without full conversations, 4) Use specialized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to pull in relevant documentation on-demand, and 5) Design the AI to ask clarifying questions to focus on the most important information. This creates a system that feels like it has unlimited memory while actually working within token limits.

                    <div class="answer" id="q25">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> This prompt is far too vague! It doesn't specify what "it" is, what "better" means, or provide any context. The AI has no clear direction on what to improve or how to improve it. A better prompt would specify exactly what needs improvement and what criteria define "better" in that context.

                    <div class="answer" id="q27">
                        <strong>Answer:</strong> They should implement multiple safeguards: 1) <strong>Role specification:</strong> "You are a legal research assistant, not a licensed attorney," 2) <strong>Clear limitations:</strong> "Provide draft language that requires attorney review and approval," 3) <strong>Reference requirements:</strong> "Base suggestions on provided legal templates and precedents only," 4) <strong>Disclaimers:</strong> Always require human lawyer verification, 5) <strong>Structured output:</strong> Request citations to legal sources, confidence levels, and alternative approaches, 6) <strong>Context provision:</strong> Include relevant statutes, regulations, and firm-specific language preferences, 7) <strong>Version control:</strong> Track prompt iterations and AI responses for audit trails. Most importantly, they should never rely solely on AI output for final legal documents.
